				<h2>History Of The Coins</h2>
					<p>To cut through some of the confusion surrounding bitcoin, we need to separate it into two components. On the one hand, you have bitcoin-the-token, a snippet of code that represents ownership of a digital concept – sort of like a virtual IOU. On the other hand, you have bitcoin-the-protocol, a distributed network that maintains a ledger of balances of bitcoin-the-token. Both are referred to as "bitcoin."

					The system enables payments to be sent between users without passing through a central authority, such as a bank or payment gateway. It is created and held electronically. Bitcoins aren't printed, like dollars or euros – they're produced by computers all around the world, using free software.

					It was the first example of what we today call cryptocurrencies, a growing asset class that shares some characteristics of traditional currencies, with verification based on cryptography.

					<p>The first step was made in 2007 with the writing of the code. Later, on November 2008 the whitepaper was published on The Cryptography Mailing list at metzdowd by a programmer, or a group of programmers, using the name of <em><a href="http://www.btcsatoshi.com/">Satoshi Nakamoto</a></em>. It was titled “Bitcoin: A-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”we know about its creator with you, and explore some of the logical reasons behind their anonymity.of Bitcoin's 10th anniversary, we've decided to delve into its origins, share what we know about its creator with you, and explore some of </p>
